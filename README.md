# rupdater

As there is no integrated automated update mechanism for the programs from rose_swe we provide the Shell script `rupdater` for the following sites:

* <http://rose.rult.at/>

* <http://www.cfg2html.com>

You can use the shell script `rupdater.sh` (for <http://rose.rult.at>) if you have a *NIX environment to download updates of the programs. The scripts relies on standard POSIX commands like wget, awk etc.

Source code of rupdater can be found at <https://github.com/roseswe/rupdater>
